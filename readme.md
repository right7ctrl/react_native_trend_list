# React Native Trend List

The react-native clone of the trend listing app which i've been developed Flutter and released on Play Store before.

  - [See the live Flutter version from Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viennasoft.trendler)


##### Where the data comes out?

  - The data app used is coming from an API which i've built before to use it on Flutter version. Basically it works a simple web-scraper.
  - Feel free to use it as your own.
